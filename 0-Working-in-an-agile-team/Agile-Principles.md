# Working in an Agile Team

## What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is like building with Lego blocks instead of carving a statue from marble. Traditional project management (Waterfall) is like carving that statue - you plan every detail upfront, create detailed documentation, then execute the plan step by step. If you make a mistake or want to change something, you're in trouble because it's expensive and time-consuming to fix.

Agile is more like building with Lego - you have a general idea of what you want to build, but you work in small pieces, test each piece, get feedback, and adjust as you go. You deliver working pieces regularly instead of waiting months to show the final product.

## What are the core values and principles of Agile?

The Agile Manifesto has 4 core values:
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

The key principles that matter most are: deliver working software frequently, welcome changing requirements, work closely with customers, keep teams motivated, communicate face-to-face when possible, and regularly reflect on how to improve.

## What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

**Scrum** works in fixed time periods called sprints (usually 2 weeks). You plan what you'll build, work on it, then review and repeat. It has specific roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner) and meetings (daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives).

**Kanban** is a continuous flow system with no fixed time periods. You visualize work on a board moving from "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Done" and limit how much work you take on at once.

Use **Scrum** for complex projects that need regular planning cycles. Use **Kanban** for ongoing work with varying priorities like bug fixes and maintenance.

## Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

Focus Bear probably uses Kanban because:
1. They need to respond quickly to user feedback and bug reports
2. Work varies in size (small UI fixes vs major features)  
3. Continuous delivery fits better than waiting for sprint boundaries
4. Less meeting overhead means more time for actual development

## What are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

**Benefits:**
- Get feedback quickly before building the wrong thing
- Deliver value to users sooner
- Teams feel more ownership and motivation
- Better quality through continuous testing

**Challenges:**  
- Can feel chaotic without enough structure
- Requires discipline to do retrospectives and improvements
- Easy to skip documentation
- Needs whole team to buy into collaborative approach

## How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Agile helps me as an intern by encouraging regular feedback instead of working alone for weeks, emphasizing learning and continuous improvement, focusing on building working code rather than perfect documentation, and teaching me to be comfortable with changing requirements - which makes me more adaptable and valuable to the team.

## Main differences between Scrum and Kanban

Scrum uses fixed time periods (sprints) with specific roles and meetings. Kanban uses continuous flow with work-in-progress limits and no required roles or meetings. Scrum is more structured, Kanban is more flexible.

## One Agile principle I find most useful  

**"Working software is the primary measure of progress"** - This keeps me focused on building things that actually work instead of getting stuck in endless planning or documentation. As someone learning to code, I learn more by building and testing real features than by writing perfect specifications.
