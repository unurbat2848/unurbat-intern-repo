# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban helps me see all my work at once on a visual board, so I can easily spot when I have too many tasks in progress. The WIP (work in progress) limits force me to finish current tasks before starting new ones, which prevents me from getting overwhelmed. I can also see which tasks are blocked or taking too long, so I can ask for help or reprioritize. This keeps me focused on completing things instead of starting everything at once.

## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

As a backend developer, I can improve my workflow by:
- Setting a WIP limit of 2-3 tasks so I focus on finishing APIs before starting new ones
- Moving tasks to "Blocked" when I'm waiting for requirements or code reviews, so the team knows I need help
- Breaking large features into smaller tasks that move through the board faster
- Using a "Ready for Testing" column so QA knows when features are complete
- Reviewing my board daily to identify bottlenecks in my development process

## Focus Bear's Kanban board structure

In a typical Focus Bear Kanban setup, tasks would likely move through columns like: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Done. Tasks would represent features, bug fixes, and improvements to the productivity app.

## Task tracking improvement for backend development

One way I can improve task tracking is to break down backend work into smaller, more specific tasks. Instead of having one large task like "Build user authentication system," I could create separate tasks for "Design user database schema," "Create login API endpoint," "Implement JWT tokens," and "Add password validation." This makes progress more visible and helps identify exactly where I might get stuck.
