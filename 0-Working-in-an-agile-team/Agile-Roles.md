# Roles in an Agile Team

## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

As a backend developer, I build the server-side foundation that everything else depends on. I create APIs, design databases, and handle business logic. In Agile, I contribute by estimating how long features will take, participating in planning sessions, writing code that can be tested quickly, and collaborating with other team members to deliver working software regularly.

## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles?

I work closely with frontend developers to design APIs that match their needs. I help QA understand how features work so they can test them properly. I translate the product manager's requirements into technical solutions and explain what's possible within our time constraints. When there are production issues, I work with DevOps to debug and fix problems.

## How your role fits into the Agile team

As a backend developer, I'm the bridge between business ideas and working software. I take feature requests and turn them into reliable APIs and database designs. My code is the foundation that frontend developers and mobile apps build on, so I need to write clean code and communicate clearly about what I'm building.

## One other role you frequently collaborate with and how to improve teamwork

I work most closely with frontend developers. To improve our teamwork, I can document my APIs better with clear examples, involve them in API design discussions, set up better development environments so they can test easily, and communicate early when I need to change something that affects their code.
