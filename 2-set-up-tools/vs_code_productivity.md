#### Shortcuts I Use Most
- **Multiple Cursors**: This is a must-have for me when I need to make the same change in multiple places.
- **Go to File/Symbol**: Super helpful for quickly jumping around my project.
- **Comment/Uncomment**: I use this all the time when testing or reviewing code.
- **Show Terminal**: I like being able to open the terminal quickly without leaving the editor.

#### How Keyboard Shortcuts Help Me
Using keyboard shortcuts really speeds up my workflow. I donâ€™t have to keep reaching for the mouse, so I can stay focused and get things done faster. They make it easier to navigate, edit, and debug my code, and help me avoid repetitive tasks. The more shortcuts I learn, the more productive I feel when coding.
