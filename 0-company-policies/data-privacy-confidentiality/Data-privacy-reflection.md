# Data Privacy & Confidentiality - Reflection

## What did you learn about Focus Bear's approach to data privacy and confidentiality?

After reading Focus Bear's privacy policy, I learned that they collect personal information like emails and phone numbers, along with behavioral data about user habits and productivity patterns. They use this data to improve their service while following GDPR rules and encrypting sensitive information. What impressed me is that they limit internal access - only team members who actually need to see user data can access it. They also partner with trusted services like Auth0 and AWS to keep data secure, and they give users control over their information with options to view, edit, or delete their data.

## What types of data should be treated as confidential at Focus Bear?

Any information that can identify users or reveal details about their personal lives should be confidential. This includes obvious things like names, emails, and phone numbers, but also behavioral data about productivity habits, work schedules, and lifestyle patterns. Even technical information like device types and usage statistics should be protected because it can be used to identify specific users. Financial data and support conversations are also confidential since they contain personal details about users' situations.

## How will you ensure you handle confidential data securely in your daily work?

I'll always double-check who I'm sending emails to before hitting send, especially with any user data involved. I'll make sure to lock my computer every time I step away, even for just a minute, and keep my workspace clean so no sensitive information is visible to others. I'll only access data that I actually need for my work and ask my supervisor if I'm ever unsure about proper procedures. If I notice anything suspicious or make a mistake, I'll report it immediately rather than trying to fix it myself.

## What would you do if you suspected a data breach?

If I suspected a data breach, I'd immediately disconnect any affected systems to prevent further damage and notify my supervisor and IT team right away. I'd document exactly what I observed and when it happened. I wouldn't try to investigate on my own since that could destroy evidence or make things worse. I'd follow whatever response procedures the company has in place and help with the investigation by providing accurate information about what I noticed.

## New Data Privacy Habit for Focus Bear

The new data privacy habit I will follow at Focus Bear is the "Need-to-Know Check" routine. Before accessing any user data or sharing information internally, I'll ask myself: "Do I actually need this information to complete my current task?" If the answer isn't clearly yes, I won't access it. When sharing data with colleagues, I'll verify they have a legitimate business reason for seeing it. This habit will help protect user privacy by ensuring data is only accessed when truly necessary and by the right people.
