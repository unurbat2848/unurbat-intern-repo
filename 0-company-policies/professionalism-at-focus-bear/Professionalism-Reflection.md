# Professionalism at Focus Bear - Reflection

## Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

Yes, I experienced great teamwork during a university group project last semester. What made it really effective was that everyone listened to each other's ideas without interrupting. When someone made a mistake, the team helped them fix it instead of blaming them. Everyone did what they promised to do and let others know if they were running late. We also celebrated when someone did good work, which made everyone feel appreciated. The team leader always asked for everyone's opinion before making decisions, so nobody felt left out.

## What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

I will think before I speak or send messages, especially about sensitive topics. When I don't understand something, I'll ask questions instead of guessing. I'll use simple words and explain context so people understand what I mean. I learned that people have different communication styles - some like short messages, others prefer detailed explanations, so I'll try to match their preference. I won't gossip about coworkers or make jokes that might hurt someone's feelings. I'll also give credit to people when they help me or do good work.

## How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

I can bring a positive attitude to work and encourage teammates when they're having tough times. I'll celebrate when people achieve their goals, even small ones. When someone needs help, I'll volunteer if I can. I'll be reliable and do what I promise to do. I want to show genuine interest in my coworkers as people, not just work relationships. I'll also keep a balance between having fun and being professional - I know we can laugh and be ourselves while still being respectful and getting work done.

## How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

Before meetings, I'll read the agenda and prepare questions about things I don't understand. If there are topics I'm not familiar with, I'll research them first so I can contribute to discussions. I'll write down important points I want to discuss so I don't forget them. For video meetings, I'll test my internet and camera beforehand to avoid technical problems. I'll join meetings on time or a few minutes early. During meetings, I'll take notes about important decisions and action items, then follow up afterwards to make sure I understand what I need to do.

## What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

Being proactive means I won't wait for someone to tell me what to do next. When I finish a task early, I'll ask for more work or find ways to help the team. If I notice a problem or have an idea to make something better, I'll speak up. I'll ask for feedback regularly instead of waiting for formal reviews because I want to improve continuously. Before asking for help, I'll try to research and find solutions myself first. I'll also share useful information or resources I discover with my teammates.

## How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?

If I need something from a colleague, I'll send a polite message and wait about 3-5 days for a response. If they don't respond, I'll send another friendly reminder mentioning my previous request. If it's really urgent and I still don't get a response after 1-2 weeks, I'll talk to my supervisor about it. If my supervisor doesn't respond to urgent requests, I'll escalate to their manager, but only if the delay is affecting important deadlines or project goals. I'll always be respectful and assume people are busy, not ignoring me on purpose.

## What are some things you won't do?

I won't gossip about my coworkers or share confidential company information with people outside the company. I won't make jokes or comments that could offend someone or make them uncomfortable. I won't miss deadlines without telling people in advance and explaining why. I won't take credit for work that other people did. I won't ignore company rules or policies, even if I think they're unnecessary. I won't post negative things about Focus Bear on social media. I won't engage in bullying or toxic behavior toward anyone, even in a casual work environment. Basically, I won't do anything that could hurt the team or damage Focus Bear's reputation.
