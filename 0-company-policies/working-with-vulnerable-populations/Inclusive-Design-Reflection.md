# Working with Vulnerable Populations - Reflection

## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I need to be more direct and clear in my communication, avoiding vague language or assumptions that people will understand implied meanings. Instead of saying "when you get a chance," I'll specify deadlines like "by end of day Friday." I'll provide step-by-step instructions rather than high-level overviews, and I'll check for understanding by asking specific questions rather than just "does that make sense?" I also need to respect that some people process information differently - some prefer written communication over verbal, and others might need extra time to respond thoughtfully.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

Common pitfalls include overwhelming interfaces with too many options at once, unclear navigation that changes unexpectedly, and using jargon or complex language in instructions. Flashing animations or sudden sounds can be problematic for people with sensory sensitivities. Making users remember multiple steps without clear visual cues is another issue. Error messages that are vague or blame the user ("You did something wrong") instead of being helpful can cause frustration. Also, assuming that all users want the same level of gamification or social features - some people find badges and points stressful rather than motivating.

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

I will always include clear, specific examples when writing documentation or instructions. Instead of writing "configure your settings," I'll write "click the gear icon in the top right corner, then select 'Notifications' from the menu." I'll also test any interface I create by trying to use it while distracted or tired, which helps me identify where cognitive load is too high. This simple practice of being more specific and testing under realistic conditions will make my work more accessible to people with executive functioning challenges.

I read several blog posts and Reddit discussions from people with ADHD and Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. One particularly insightful account was from someone who explained how overwhelming it felt when productivity apps kept adding new features or changing their interface layout. They mentioned that just when they had learned where everything was, an update would move buttons around, forcing them to relearn the system.

Another person described how generic motivational messages actually made them feel worse when they were struggling, because the messages felt disconnected from their real challenges. They preferred tools that acknowledged that some days are harder than others and provided gentle, practical guidance rather than cheerful encouragement.

Based on these accounts, one design improvement for Focus Bear would be to offer a "simplified interface" option that reduces visual clutter and keeps the most essential functions easily accessible. This would help users who get overwhelmed by too many choices or visual elements.
