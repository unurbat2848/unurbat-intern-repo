# Cyber Security Guidelines - Reflection

## What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

I currently use KeePass2 as my password manager, which is good for storing unique passwords for different accounts. I also try to keep my computer updated and use Windows Defender for antivirus protection. However, I realize I need to improve in several areas. I sometimes use public WiFi without thinking about security risks, and I don't always lock my computer when I step away from it. I also haven't enabled two-factor authentication on all my important accounts yet, which I know I should do. I need to be more careful about clicking links in emails and double-checking if they're legitimate before clicking.

## How can you make secure behavior a habit rather than an afterthought?

I want to set up automatic routines so security becomes natural. I'll set my computer to automatically lock after 2 minutes of being idle, and I'll practice pressing Windows+L every time I leave my desk, even for just a moment. I'll make it a habit to always check email addresses and hover over links before clicking them. When I'm working from different locations, I'll always connect to my VPN first before doing any work. I'll also schedule monthly reminders to review my passwords and security settings to make sure everything is still secure.

## What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

Since I'm already using KeePass2, I'll continue using it and make sure all my passwords are unique and strong. I'll go through all my accounts and enable two-factor authentication on important ones like email, work accounts, and banking. I'll use my phone's authenticator app or SMS for the second factor. I'll also check if any of my accounts have been involved in data breaches by using tools like "Have I Been Pwned" and change those passwords immediately. I'll make sure my KeePass2 database itself is protected with a strong master password and keep it backed up securely.

## What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

If I suspect a security breach, I'll act quickly. First, I'll immediately change the password for that account and any other accounts that use the same password. I'll disconnect from the internet to prevent further damage if I think malware might be involved. I'll check my account activity logs to see what actions were taken and when. I'll enable two-factor authentication if it wasn't already on. I'll run a full antivirus scan on my computer and check for any suspicious files or programs. Most importantly, I'll report it to my supervisor or IT team right away so they can help secure the company's systems and data.

## New Cyber Security Habit for Focus Bear

The new cyber security habit I will follow at Focus Bear is the "Lock and Check" routine. Every time I step away from my computer, even for just a few minutes, I'll press Windows+L to lock it. Before opening any email attachments or clicking any links, I'll take 3 seconds to check: Does the sender look legitimate? Does the link URL match what I expect? When in doubt, I'll ask a colleague or supervisor before clicking. This simple habit will protect both my work and Focus Bear's data from common attacks like phishing and unauthorized access when I'm away from my desk.
