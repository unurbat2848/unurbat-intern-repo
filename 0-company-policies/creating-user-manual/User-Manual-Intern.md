# User Manual for Focus Bear Intern

## My role
- I am working on backend software developer intern
- The days and times I work are: Monday and Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM

## How I Work Best
- I do my best work when I have clear, specific instructions and examples to follow. I like breaking complex tasks into smaller steps and getting feedback early in the process.
- I struggle when requirements are vague or when I'm expected to know something that hasn't been explained yet. I also find it hard to focus when there are too many interruptions.

## Communication Style
- I prefer messages to be direct and specific, with clear action items or deadlines. I appreciate examples when learning new concepts.
- The best way to reach me is through email or the team messaging platform during work hours. I respond well to written communication because it gives me time to process and ask good questions.
- If you need something urgent, send me a message and mention it's urgent - I'll prioritize it and respond as quickly as possible.

## Collaboration & Teamwork
- I work best in a team when expectations are clear and everyone feels comfortable asking questions. I like when we check in regularly on progress.
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is when people assume I understand something without checking, or when plans change without clear communication.
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I'm processing the information and thinking through my questions. I prefer to ask thoughtful questions rather than speaking immediately.

## Focus & Productivity
- I stay focused by working in blocks of time with specific goals, keeping my workspace organized, and taking short breaks between tasks.
- Things that distract me include unexpected interruptions during deep work, unclear priorities when I have multiple tasks, and noisy environments.
- The best way to support my productivity is to give me context for why tasks matter and how they fit into bigger goals.

## Feedback & Growth
- I like feedback to be specific and constructive, with concrete examples of what worked well and what could be improved. I prefer it delivered privately first.
- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is to explain what happened, why it matters, and what I can do differently next time. I appreciate patience as I learn.
- I appreciate it when teammates take time to explain the reasoning behind decisions and share their thought processes.

## Fun Facts & Quirks
- A fun fact about me is that I learn best by doing hands-on work and then reflecting on what I learned through writing.
