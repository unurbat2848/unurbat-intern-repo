## Why are PRs important in a team workflow?
A Pull Request  is like asking permission to add your changes to the main project. Instead of directly putting your code into the main branch, you create a PR to show others what you want to change.

## What makes a well-structured PR?

A good Pull Request has these parts:

### 1. Title
- Short description of what you changed
- Example: "Fix login button not working on mobile"

### 2. Description
- Explain what you changed and why
- List any special instructions for testing
- Link to related issues if there are any

### 3. Files Changed
- Shows exactly which files you modified
- Shows the old code vs. new code side by side
- Reviewers can comment on specific lines

### 4. Discussion
- Place for teammates to ask questions
- Suggest improvements
- Approve the changes

## What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?
- Always write a clear title and description
- Check all your changes before submitting
- Be ready to make changes based on feedback
- Merge conflicts are normal and can be fixed
