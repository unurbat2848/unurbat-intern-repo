# Screenshots - REST API Testing

## Screenshots Required for Issue 38

To complete this issue, screenshots should be taken of:

1. **Terminal showing successful API tests** - The command line output showing all CRUD operations working
2. **Server logs** - NestJS application startup logs showing all routes mapped
3. **API test results** - The formatted JSON responses from each endpoint test

## Test Commands Used:
```bash
# Start server
cd demo-project && npm start

# Test all endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/products
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/products/1
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/products -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Webcam","price":150,"description":"HD webcam"}'
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/4 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"4K Webcam","price":180}'
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/products/4
```

## Evidence of Completion:
- ✅ All CRUD endpoints implemented
- ✅ Business logic separated in ProductsService  
- ✅ Controller properly structured with decorators
- ✅ Dependency injection working correctly
- ✅ All API tests passing
- ✅ Server running and responding to requests
