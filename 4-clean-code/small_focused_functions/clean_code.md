## Best Practices for Writing Small, Single-Purpose Functions

- Each function should do one thing and do it well.
- Use clear, descriptive names that explain what the function does.
- Keep functions shortâ€”ideally, they should fit on one screen.
- If a function is getting too long or complex, break it into smaller helper functions.

## Example of a Long, Complex Function

```js
function processOrder(order) {
	// Validate order
	if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
		throw new Error('No items in order');
	}
	// Calculate total
	let total = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < order.items.length; i++) {
		total += order.items[i].price * order.items[i].quantity;
	}
	// Apply discount
	if (order.coupon) {
		total = total * 0.9;
	}
	// Print receipt
	console.log('Order for:', order.customer);
	console.log('Total:', total);
	return total;
}
```
This function does too many things at once, making it hard to read and maintain.

## Refactored Code with Small, Focused Functions

```js
function validateOrder(order) {
	if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
		throw new Error('No items in order');
	}
}

function calculateTotal(order) {
	return order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}

function applyDiscount(total, coupon) {
	return coupon ? total * 0.9 : total;
}

function printReceipt(order, total) {
	console.log('Order for:', order.customer);
	console.log('Total:', total);
}

function processOrder(order) {
	validateOrder(order);
	let total = calculateTotal(order);
	total = applyDiscount(total, order.coupon);
	printReceipt(order, total);
	return total;
}
```
Now, each function has a single responsibility, and the main processOrder function is much easier to follow.

## Why is breaking down functions beneficial?
I think breaking down functions makes code much easier to read and understand. In my understanding, smaller functions are easier to test, debug, and reuse. If something goes wrong, it's also simpler to find and fix the problem in a small function than in a big one.

## How did refactoring improve the structure of the code?
Also, refactoring made the code much cleaner and more organized. We can see that after refactoring, each function now has a clear job, so it's easier to see what each part does. This makes the whole codebase easier to work with and update in the future.
